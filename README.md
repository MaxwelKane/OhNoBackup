# Emergency:
## Phone Stolen/Broke:
App store is under one email 
and apple is under main email
For apple photos, we should have it backed up to google. Give me a minute on that. 

## Computer Stolen/Broke:
The thing is, I have 3 computers.
Desktop: There is litterally nothing on here. Probably good if it dies because of the fucked config I have on it.

Primary Laptop: Everything should be backed up to the cloud in a Folder for primary laptop.

Secondary Laptop:
Everything should've been ported a while ago. There should be a folder for this as well under old laptop.

### Computer Setup
vs code, github, google shit, proton vpn, xournal, latex, prog languages. 

## All Gone
Don't Jump!!
Everything should be in amazon, google, idrive, you have the extra bitwarden account with all of the backup codes.
There should also be a large physical backup drive somewhere safe.


Okay, all of my files are on my laptop, google drive, laptop, desktop computer. 

My backup stack: 
IDrive,
AWS s3 glacier,
Google Drive,
Physical hard drive
(Hopefully a nas one day)

# YubiKey 
I have 2 Yubikey Keys. 
## YubiKey Pins 

5C Pin Phone pass the one thatâ€™s like about working on urself. I don't know if it's standard, but 2 is ABC, 9 is WXYZ.

My other pin should be 123456, but idk. 

# Backup Codes
Backup codes are kept in a seperate bitwarden account. 
Without getting specific, this account is the one you use for financial stuff. The password is also pretty hard. 


### Backup codes stored in second bitwarden account:
Github
Google
Bitwarden


# Data Backup

Rclone is compatible with everything here
If not, there is an automatic sync. 

**See todo we need to take out idrive autobackup**

Phone: On device, iCloud, Google Drive, S3 Glacier, Physical (Different regions of couse)

Laptop: On device, Google Drive, Github, S3 Glacier, physical

Desktop: None needed, no information
Extra laptop: Same as above. 

Bitwarden: on device, bitwarden cloud
